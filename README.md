## Planning and Testing Process
- First I started by gathering the requirements that I was going to test , which is 4 , one for each page of the application.
- I started learning and reading about Appium and how to use it from various resources.
- Then I decided to divide the testing process to be 75% Automated and 25% as Manual.
- Then I started to setup my testing environment and setting up all the required tools.
- After that , I began forming my Test Design and writing down the test cases for the manual testing , and writing the script for the automated testing.
- For the first iteration ,  I executed all my test cases (55 in total) 39 automated / 16 manual , which resulted with 4 defetcts , All details of this can be found in the [test-output folder](./test-output) .
- After reporting the defects to the awsome developer , he fixed all those bugs.
- Finally , the second iteration had 100% successful testing , also the details of the second iteration can be found in the [test-output folder](./test-output).

## Problem-Solving Strategy

- lots and lots of **googling** and reading official **documentation**.
- Guidance from the instructor Neeraj Singh.
